# liri-node-app

Like Siri, but with language instead of speech. (And only takes a few commands!)

This is a CLI, so to run the app - you will need clone the app from github and run it yourself. You will need to supply your own .env file and match it up to the keys file for it to work. Don't forget to npm install!

To access commands enter into your command line: `node liri.js <command>`

Here are the commands to input:

* `my-tweets` 

* `spotify-this-song` <'your song here'>

* `movie-this` <'your movie here'>

* `do-what-it-says`
